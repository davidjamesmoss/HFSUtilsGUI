#HFSUtils GUI

HFS is the "[Hierarchical File System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System)", the native volume format used on old Macintosh computers. *Hfsutils* is the name of a comprehensive software package developed by Robert Leslie to permit manipulation of HFS volumes from UNIX and other systems.

*HFS Utils GUI* is a modern interface that allows this package to be easily used by OSX users, filling a gap left on the native support provided by Apple in the past few years.

Please refer to [HFSUtils official website](http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/hfs/) for more information on the original console applications by Robert Leslie.
